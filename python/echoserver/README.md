- history of `IPV6_RECVPKTINFO`, `IPV6_PKTINFO`
- figure out why kernel stores into `msghdr.msg_name` an address of `::ffff:127.0.0.1` yet give an ipv4 address in `IP_PKTINFO` control message

		And it means that it is an IPv6 socket that is used for IPv4
		communication. Application and socket-wise, it is IPv6 but network and
		packet-wise it is IPv4. This is allowed as a transition mechanism if
		net.ipv6.bindv6only=0 and the application didn't set the socket option
		IPV6_V6ONLY.

		It seems that some recent OSes disable this option by default so that
		IPv6 sockets can handle only real IPv6 communications.

		The best approach is to create an IPv6 server socket that can also
		accept IPv4 connections. To do so, create a regular IPv6 socket,
		turn off the socket option IPV6_V6ONLY, bind it to the "any"
		address, and start receiving. IPv4 addresses will be presented as
		IPv6 addresses, in the IPv4-mapped format.
